Title: SOD for multidimensional scaling.

Description: SOD (Self-Organising-Deltoids) provides multidimensional scaling by gradually reducing the dimensionality of an initial space and using the resulting stress in the configuration to re-arrange nodes. Stress is calculated from the errors in the inter-node distances, and the sum of the stresses at each node is combined to create N-dimensional force vectors that direct the movement of nodes as the dimensionality is iteratively reduced.
